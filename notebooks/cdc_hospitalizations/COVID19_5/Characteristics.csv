"1.COVID-NET hospitalization data are preliminary and subject to change as more data become available. In particular, case counts and rates for recent hospital admissions are subject to delay. Lag for COVID-NET case identification and reporting might increase around holidays or during periods of increased hospital utilization. As data are received each week, prior case counts and rates are updated accordingly."
"2. White, Black, Asian/Pacific Islander and American Indian/Alaska Native all represent non-Hispanic ethnicity groups; Other includes persons in multiple race categories and persons for whom race is unknown."
"3. All data presented, including demographics (age, sex, race and ethnicity), interventions and outcomes, underlying medical conditions, signs/symptoms at admission, and discharge diagnoses  are restricted to sampled and completed cases with non-missing data reported during March 1, 2020  November 30, 2021. Due to the sampling methodology for adults aged >=18 years, counts and unweighted percentages are only presented for demographic data. Weighted percentages are presented for intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, in-hospital death, underlying medical conditions, signs/symptoms at admission, and discharge diagnoses."
