The earlier of the Clinical Date (date related to the illness or specimen collection) or the Date Received by CDC.

It is an option to end-users who need a date variable with optimized completeness. The logic of cdc_case_earliest_dt is to use the non-null date of one variable when the other is null and to use the earliest valid date when both dates are available. If no date available, then left blank.
